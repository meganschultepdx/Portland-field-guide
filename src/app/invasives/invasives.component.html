      <div class="text">
        <p>The plants on this list are invasive; they threaten the health and vitality of native habitats, humans, and
          cause economic harm to public and to private landowners. Planting of these plants should be avoided and
          removal
          encouraged.</p>
          <img src="../../assets/img/vine.png" alt="vine icon" width="125px">
          <p>Some were intentionally introduced, while others arrived incidentally. Non-native or ornamental plants can be planted in gardens; vehicles can track plant seeds on tires; humans can track seeds on their shoes, and livestock and pets can transport seed on their fur or feet or through their excrement; many plant seeds or plant parts (e.g. knotweed rhizomes or shoots) are dispersed by wind and water.</p>
          <img src="../../assets/img/vine.png" alt="vine icon" width="125px">
          <p id="bottomText">Knowing how plants reproduce and spread is very helpful in preventing the vector
            distribution and controlling populations once established. While many non-native plants introduced into this region have reproduced rapidly, not all non-native plants
          become invasive. When plants are no longer in their native environment, they enter new relationships within
          the
          ecological communities they occupy. Sometimes, they cause very little disruption to the systems they enter,
          while
          at other times they cause great disturbance. </p>
