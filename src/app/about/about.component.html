      <p>
        Portland field guide is a collaborative website made with the idea of
        helping ease people into the world of local Portland plant

        It provides the user with a database of local flora that they can use to
        search for info on plants they are curious about and also be inspired to
        start noticing and identifying the plants around the on hikes/walks
        around the city.
